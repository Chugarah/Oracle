Applying for job after job and not getting any interviews?   Perhaps you’ve got a few interviews but always seem to get passed over for the job?   Or maybe you’re not satisfied with your current career and want a change.  Well, you’ve come to the right place.   \n \nAs a corporate recruiter with over 20 years of experience hiring thousands of employees at all levels into major corporations, I’m going to spill the beans on how to get noticed by recruiters, start getting more interviews, navigate through each step of the hiring process, and ultimately land the dream job you deserve.   \n \nBut that’s not all - I firmly believe that to truly experience career success, you need to think bigger.   Multiple streams of income and budgeting are crucial to forming a layoff-free lifestyle and helping you achieve your goals.    \n \nIf these are things you’re struggling with, that’s what I specialize in.   I’ve got a website called A Life After Layoff.   It’s loaded with tips and tricks for getting noticed, interviewed, and hired by your dream company.    Make sure you check it out!   \n \nI’ve got weekly videos coming at you, so make sure to subscribe.   You won’t want to miss a post.

\"family\" atmosphere. I graduated college in 2019 right before the pandemic so couldnt find a job for almost a year because of covid. So frankly at the time I was desperate. I was told during the interview that they were SPECIFICALLY looking for people with geology degrees, which was my degree. I moved from Texas, all the way to indiana for this job, with no relocation assistence i might add. They werent going to hire me initally becuse i needed \"too long to move there\" i dont think 4 weeks is tol much to ask to move halfway across the country. My boss said \"if you can get here in 2 weeks you have the job\" so i packed up and moved. NOT A SINGLE PERSON they hired in my position even remotelay had a degree, even though it said it was tequired for the position and i was making 18 an hour just like people woth no degree, had a boss that yelled and cussed at me all the time when we messed up and constantly walked on eggshells. Anyway a whole situation with me and my boss ensued, basically he was homophobic and i knew he was because i heard him say it begore to other people putsode of work. He knew i was gay and made my life a living hell because of it. All the sudden when he found out i was put on a performance improvement plan, never got a verbal warning, neber got written up, just automatic PIP. Any way i left. Now im workingnfor a new company in Arizona rhat i LOVE and that boss ended up getting fired because i called HR on him.

If you hear that your boss believes in some hollow moon lizard people stuff, or the illuminati really killed JFK, I would steer clear from them because delusion has a way of infecting the rest of their thoughts. I'd also avoid people who are overly religious, and to clarify on that,  one of my previous bosses refused to let \"Highway to Hell\" be played on the radio in her presence. That was weird, yes, but not as weird as her accusing me of summoning demons into her house and presenting a picture of \"orbing\" in her living room to management to justify her claims. Bottom line, don't work for the delusional. \n\n2) The nanosecond they start playing games with your payroll, you need to be out that door. Even if they explain that times are tough and they'll \"pay you the rest later\", I have rarely seen this to be the case. People who owe you money tend to find reasons to dislike you, and you might find yourself being \"let go\" for \"unsatisfactory performance\" because your boss owes you money.

Most managers are ok, but I've encountered a small number who were bad enough to motivate a job change.\n\nCompanies should also remember that employees have families.

So when a company comes along and promises to be their proxy family, such a company is taking unrighteous advantage of a very natural need in those younger adults.  Remember:  it is great to find fulfillment at a job, but 99% of people who work never do so.  So do not look for it there.  And here is the important thing:  that is not a bad thing (so do not act as if the company denied you something that it owed you).  A job is just a paycheck machine:  the means by which you earn the money to pay for building a hopefully fulfilling life outside of work.  At work, people with whom you would never otherwise associate, meet and tolerate each other's existence long enough to extract a paycheck from the situation.  Do your best to play the game at work (and keep that paycheck), but never let the game play you.  And when a time comes to make a move, then make sure that every move is a step forward and upward.  If there are no opportunities at the moment, then bide your time, keep looking, but continue to earn that paycheck.  Seek fulfillment in your personal lives.

In any case they used ancient technology and tried to patch an already sinking boat. It was laughable cause simple things were overly complicated. They also gave you responsibility of their own crappy code that you had to correct, while making unrelated changes. Then they code reviewed your stuff and blamed you for their own old code mistakes. They always used metrics that you didn't have a clue about and would use scare tactics. That's the worst company I ever been on in my 23+ years in IT. The boss that fired me got fired himself two months later... go figure. FYI... Something your video might've not mentioned...

Basically, when everyone showed up for work, we had just the bare minimum of employees to get everything done. The moment the unthinkable happened, such as someone taking a vacation or became sick, we'd have to spread out people over several positions, otherwise, we'd be unable to fulfill our legal obligations. This of course lead to overtime hours, which would increase the issue: When someone reduces work-hours to decrease his overtime, that'd mean someone else would have to pick up the workload and this would lead to them having overtime.\n\nAgain: My department manager tried to get more employees for over a year, the chief manager always sneered at him and said he'll have to make do with what he has, cause the department was \"bloated\" anyway...\n\nFor me personally, that meant that I had to pick up a lot of extra workload in order to keep things running, I essentially ran three different projects at the same time and racked up almost an entire months worth of overtime in a few months.\n\nEventually, my department manager pulled a few strings and switched to a different department under a different chief manager, ironically, this meant that me and another co-worker were able to also \"jump ship\" with him.\n\nThe chief manager now had to take care of the department himself and despite being down 3 people, he was still adamant about having TOO MANY employees.\nWithin two weeks of him running the department, 11 of the remaining 12 people quit or decided to quit as soon as they got any other job.\n\nWhat really pisses me off, is that we managed to get through the pandemic, we were on a course to grow and the chief manager pissed that all away through sheer incompetence. And even though the CEO KNOWS all this, he doesn't fire this massively incompetent buffoon.\nSo, long story short: I'm now in a new department, it's better than before, but I'll be in the market for a new job somewhere else at some point, given that the CEO is part of the problem.", "like_count": 1, "author_id": "UC2Z18lxPBzAE_34QyQo1pHA", "author": "@h.a.9880", "author_thumbnail": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqP4YsKO_AaRMRN_-je7wCCKqYCCXzuRWCp9ao4blLR5ZVT1MXXZdFXFhywuG1F3=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "parent": "root", "_time_text": "1 month ago", "timestamp": 1685836800, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Z18lxPBzAE_34QyQo1pHA", "author_is_uploader": false}, {"id": "Ugw2_hU76TZjO3DPi9h4AaABAg", "text": "I think I’ve worked at every one of those companies.", "author_id": "UCZnCcgUSsaTILTFYZH0N5-w", "author": "@richwightman3044", "author_thumbnail": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqOlvAVFf0k5cQitkHzhbCtqscGM7WA1A3EQoE-TrWG5iz3tLvqKhVATC9DJtM-T=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "parent": "root", "_time_text": "1 month ago", "timestamp": 1685836800, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZnCcgUSsaTILTFYZH0N5-w", "author_is_uploader": false}, {"id": "UgztKBr-mIgkI7TSGJh4AaABAg", "text": "Last company stated in their handbook that your job description was available if you requested.

That doesn't mean a bad quarter financially, but to do with a context where the work environment has took a turn. They will say it's due to X reason, but in reality that is how the business operate now for the long term. Essentially the reliance on your loyalty to stick it out during the bad times. Like the video says, it's a bad relationship that only seems to care about you when they need you. It's only a faux care and they'll NEVER put their money where their mouth is. FYI, that doesn't mean being economically placated entirely, but improving the culture.\n\nMicro sticks. Each day count how many times you get told you are doing something wrong. If it increases, then count how often this increase lasts for. It may seem minor, but how many times they use stick over carrot shows the business. I once had a job where it got so bad that I'd get 8 emails a day saying I did something wrong. In reality, it was their difficult KPIs that were impossible to achieve. They increased the volume inward work coming, while expecting same level of work and output. It became impossible and something had to give.\n\nMini promotions. Have they started giving people a title that offers no official purpose, but extract extra work out of people. Similar to the videos point of wearing many hats. It's designed so people don't notice there is a glass ceiling. It makes that person a more company person as they think they're on the pathway of progression.

When I prepared documents to report the incident, I found the data for that animal had been falsified to hide what occurred. So I filed two reports of ethical violations.  The animal death investigation came back guilty, the falsified data investigation came back not guilty because the project was so disorganized that investigators couldn't tell the difference between a mistake and deliberate falsification.

The options for work was literally this company offering a part time position in my field, or night shifts at amazon for slightly higher hourly wage.\n\nlooking up this company, major red flags all over it. Family owned and run, recently bought out by international conglomerate. scathing reviews online from former employees at different sites around the country. Thought to myself, okay, its probably going to be shit and im gonna get treated like dirt, but hey thats been the past 3 jobs, and this at least will give me money and a springboard into other jobs.\n\nWent to the interview, head of HR talked the talk, trying to big up the company and gauge me. that part went well enough that he introduced me to the CFO who basically said whats your experience, can you do the job, what salary do i expect. Gave him my expected range, saying i want more but lowest i will go is this. He said fine, i will see you monday. My initial impressions were that my boss was not only down to earth but approachable\n\nI went in and i was right, the place was a mess but by the very nature of who i am and how i work, i picked up and resolved issue after issue such so that within 3 months i was offered full time employment, regardless of the pregnancy cover. I kept at it and was offered a raise in line with the annual increase in wages (as im in the UK, national minimum wage went up at the time, i was given an increase to match this even though i was above the minimum wage). After another 6 months i was offered a promotion to the position that i am now, but it wasnt a position that the company had before and as a trial with my new responsibilities for 3 months i would take on this extra work and see how things worked out. \n\nafter the 3 months, i dropped hints that they need to look at my salary as was promised and they did and i was given an increase to match my extra duties. \n\nHaving now cleared up most of the issues and whilst i still have my extra duties, i can goof around for part of the month and i dont have to work every minute of every day. \n\nthe long and short of it all, if you are willing to put the work in, you may get rewarded.

A better word might be community.  I worked for a university, that in its earlier days, was very family oriented and that carried over to how bosses treated employees, but in a good way.  it was common in this place for people to actually care about others, and the university did nice things for their employees - like a big family picnic every summer at a park with games and ice cream trucks for the kids.  Employees loved this stuff.  They also liked their bosses who actually asked them how their families were doing, and career wise - gave them opportunities to grow.  My own father was a facilities director who was highly regarded by his employees because of how well he treated them ( I heard first-hand many stories like this).  My (ex) father in law was hired by him, with this story:  Father in law, at a much younger age and with a young family, was on strike at job.  He wouldn't cross the picket line, but he needed to work.  He came to this university looking for work, and my father said:  Are you willing to do (this kind of) work?  He hired my future father in law on the spot (you could do that in those days), and my FIL ended up staying there until the day he retired.  As he told the story, my dad gave him a job so he could feed his kids, when other companies would not, because of the strike.  It's a different world today, and I think we have lost some of this humanity in the workplace.

They had 100+ people show up and set the interviews in the cafeteria area. There were three rounds of interviews divided between three tables: something like Tier 1 and Tier 2 technical then manager. They also had two sets of these tracks to interview multiple candidates at once. Worse, everything was public to be seen by all other candidates and noisy as hell. So, every other candidate got to see your walk of shame if you did not get the job. I passed all technical questions but did not get the green light with the manager. In hindsight, that was a good thing since they got hit hard with layoffs later but the cattle call style interview system left a memorable impression. 10 years ago, that massive campus was divided up and sold off after the company who owned it went bankrupt.", "author_id": "UCUsNBhqoKVDCD_wqksmtBEQ", "author": "@darwoodtechnology", "author_thumbnail": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqPWQU5L9PY608eY0OZfzw7t0gXuOUdgssKYEHoiHg=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "parent": "root", "_time_text": "2 months ago", "timestamp": 1683158400, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUsNBhqoKVDCD_wqksmtBEQ", "author_is_uploader": false}, {"id": "UgzGX3-RHI398w6Oyqh4AaABAg", "text": "Excellent.

If I’d known the company I work for was going to be like this, I would have ran after the first day. It was a small company when I first started and it didn’t seem that bad. I had been a hairdresser for many years and got burnt out. I was looking for steady pay and benefits, so it wasn’t bad. I decided to stay. Then after a year and waiting to get hired (that was the the way they did things back then, waited a year to hire anyone, I guess to make sure you were serious about the job). I really wasn’t aware of how warehouse jobs operated. It all seemed ok at the time as it seemed things were operating pretty fairly. Once we were bought out by a bigger company, they enticed us by saying our pay would increase by a few dollars. What we didn’t realize, or should I say, what I didn’t realize is how “woke” and how more toxic it would become. If you don’t “play ball” in their way, you will be picked apart and depending on where you are from or if you are one of the original members from the previous company, they tried to get rid of all of the original staff. They did a good job of it too by firing anyone who stepped out of line at all. They almost had me but I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not admit or react to any of their false accusations. If I didn’t need a job so bad and things that are going on in the world where they are laying off so many. I’d leave! My job is an essential worker job, so that’s the only reason I stay. It does suck and I see everything going on. I know anywhere I’m gonna go, it’s going to be this way. This is the new normal. Hopefully, when a new administration comes into power, I’ll have a better chance at getting a different job that’s secure as well as where I’m currently at. Till then, I go in do what I’m asked/told. Then go home! I no longer strive to try and go above and beyond coz it doesn’t matter to them. I’m not apart of the clicks and that’s fine. They’ll get theirs. What goes around comes around. Maybe not at work, but they’ll see when their kids grow up and those same things happen to their kids. Either way, they are not going to run me off. I’m stronger than that. I’m also smarter than I let them think.

In the end, I still chose their offer since it was the exact position (Design Manager) that I wanted and the company is a well known brand in our country.\n\nLittle did I know, when I finally came in for work, the team that I was suppose to join was not even aware that I was hired. Then, it turned out that the president wanted me to be a QS/ Cost Analysis Manager and also lead the team.\n\nI was shocked. I clearly told them that I don't have any experiences or skills in quantity surveying since I am an architect for most of my career. My CV is clear about that. But I didn't have a choice. I tried to do my best, even got regularized in just 4 months but I still hate my job. I even hate the fact that we do nkt have a clear process or workflow in the company, favoritism is rampant, hardworking employees are just given more work and even handling contractors and suppliers is stressful because they have personal relationships or connections with the owners.\n\nNow I am just trying to take it day by day and actively looking for a new role that fits my skills and experiences.

Second day I asked my supervisor how the workers were supposed to tie off in their harnesses to stay safe and the supervisor screamed at me again saying they know what they are doing. That evening I went and bought a bodycam to record these interactions. Third day I asked my immediate supervisor same person if there was a certain spot that they have to set up their laser for centering . Instead of yes or no. She screamed at me again that they know what they are doing. A week and a half into the job . The guys working under me would not tie off, wear safety glasses or stay of their phones. I would ask them to tie off or wear their safety glasses or something to that effect and they would ignore me or tell me to duck off. I was hired as a Supervisor yet I was doing hard labor work the whole time I was there. The machine we were building, per the specifications was not allowed to use a steel hammer on any of it unless to drive an anchor into the floor. The workers under me would constantly use a steel hammer on the feet of it and I would repeatedly tell them that the manufacturer doesn't want that done. I reported it to my supervisor. Tuesday I told one of the workers to not use the steel hammer anymore. He tried to hit me in the head with it. I caught it as he swung it at me. He swung his other fist at me and I caught it also. I told him you have to calm down and leave. My supervisor said that they are my workers and you need to leave. I have all of my time on video and Audio as that after the second day I knew that I was in a hostile and toxic work environment. That guy is still on the job. I'm not.

If you're hired at a place which pays well, provides first class health benefits and easily accessible vacation or PTO, you'll definitely  be much happier than at a place that struggles to balance its books or relies on annual state or federal monies to pay its employees. During a job interview, ask the recruiter if the company has a budget sufficient to supply all the materials you'll need to actually do your job. If you receive an answer such as, \"We recycle paper clips\" or \"sometimes we just don't have the resources\"--run like hell. Note the condition of your surroundings. Is there a wastebasket overflowing in the interview/conference room? Is the break room/kitchen in good shape? How about the rest rooms? I'm not saying don't take a job at a non-profit or 501C-3. Those businesses often pay well and take good care of their employees. But you'll find absolutely appalling conditions in the offices of most Big Ten universities--both physical and psychological--and in many start-ups. Don't even get me started on county offices, some of which in Minnesota are still using DOS. A final word to the wise, if the company is indeed \"like family,\" that sometimes means a single approved top-down mindset. The family patriarch/business owner will make your life miserable if you demonstrate any trace of independent thought or initiative--and that goes for everything from company policies to the art on the walls. (I was once hired as office manager at the satellite office of a southern law firm. The satellite was in St. Paul, MN--very hip and together--while corporate was in Dallas. As an office-warming gift, we received from corporate a huge sculpture of a First Nations man riding a horse, which would be beautiful were it not for the title of the piece, namely \"Horse Thief.\" This occurred in 2004. In Minnesota, a major First Nations community. We also received five-pointed yellow stars as \"stressbusters\" from the same corporate office.)

I just got fired from a bad employer. I'm a manager with 15 years of experience, and I was just hired 2 months ago by a franchise to help build their business and bring in sales. Somehow, in 2 months, they expected me to bring up sales from 50k a month to 85k without knowing the full insurance and outs aswell as running a position that took me away from my managerial duties. I missed one day of work, so I only worked 30 hours one week and made it up on a day off on the next week and accumulated 9 hours of overtime... when they brought me in the office and told me they had to move money out of one account into another to cover my over time that I apparently racked up just got me. Being in two months, I had a total of 16 hours of OT, and they could not afford it? Everything you said in this video was them, but I still accepted the job because I wanted something new. While checking employees' old-time punches, I discovered days of time missing that they worked and were not paid. I brought it up to the DM, and she told me not to tell them. red flags after red flags. Last week, I had a feeling they were going to fire me and had already started looking for a new job. I cannot believe people like this can run a business and I told them while exiting that if they continue with those expectations of managers to know everything in 2 months while not providing adequate training aswell as not providing employees with pto, paid holidays, suck days and complete summers being blocked different from taking time off then they are doomed to fail. I wish I knew what I could do. I want to contact the main corporate of the franchise butt cannot seem to find contact info. Thank you for this video, and good luck to everyone who was able to overcome the toxicity or remember their value enough to leave.

I interviewed for a graphic design position with a Marketing agency. First off, I was told they are a 'start-up' that started 6 years ago.  My first interview question was, \"Tell me something that the Biden administration has done that you agree with and something you disagree with.\" I found this to be an odd question for a graphic design job but tried to answer it as neutral as possible. Before I left, I was given 3 pieces of 'homework' I was to send back to them in a week. They were 3 Marketing tasks like creating a 30 second video ad, logo design, etc. I did them and sent them back. A week later I get a call and am offered the job. I'm told they will send me a contract via email then I can sign it and we can get underway. They send me a contract which is very different from the original job posting. #1. The job is a contract position for 2 months at 25 hours/week vs. posting that said full-time with benefits. #2. Contract is for $15,000/year less than the posting. I called the employer and I was given a story about how they've had some unforeseen financial hiccups and couldn't offer me what the original posting stated. After not budging on my negotiation attempts, I rejected the offer and moved on. Is it over? Not yet...I later learned that the owner (man who interviewed me) is a former lobbyist for the Republican party and hosts his own weekly conservative podcast. So, the political question I was asked absolutely carried weight...for a graphic design job! Remember the homework I had to turn in? Two of my three projects were used months later for real, paying clients! I couldn't help but wonder how many other people they'd done this to over the years of interviewing just to profit off their 'homework.'

I've been written up for taking my time reading manuals and not doing important stuff like cleaning the floors or other busywork (not what I was hired to do).  My last career, I requested training when I first was assigned and was told \"Read the book\" on a one-of-a-kind system.

I was criticized for bothering other people (especially engineers) for asking questions.  Later when I took over as a lead technician.  I sat down and read every book, manual, schematic, theory of operation, and then trained every one of my fellow workers to the same level.

We all asked why we couldn't rehire the people they let go or get some more people because we were now doing double what we did last year. They said that because they were a start up business that everything was too tight. They had doubled their yearly income as a company over the past 5 years they had been in business- I learned that they just wanted a select few to succeed if they fit in their clique and would work everyone else ragged by promising promotions and increases in pay.

And if we hit 5 pts, it's still pretty hard to get fired. You have to really suck. All they wanna know when you call in is \"do you wanna use sick/benefit time\"? And they frequently offer incentives (prizes, raffles, extra pay) just for showing up for your scheduled shift, and working the whole thing. (I won an Oculus.) They understand that this is just a job for most of us, so seem to go out of their way to make us want to stay. They also get that sometimes, you just don't want to. It's not uncommon to call in and say, \"I'm just not feelin' it today.\" or \"I didn't get much sleep last night.\" As long we don't abuse it, and stay within our points, they're fine with it.

For example, a law firm trying to graft the culture of Dallas, Texas onto the culture of St. Paul, Minnesota. From reactionary to ultra-progressive. That scenario was attempted and did not end well. Minnesota is proud of its many Native American Tribes.

So basically, every employee in the company was getting a full week off with pay except half of my shift.\nI just told my manager straight out I won't be coming in on that day. A few others said it too but after threats of disciplinary action they all backed down. I didn't. I told my manager I won't have the piss taken out of me by anyone and that I won't be made an idiot out of.\nHe backed down and when the list came out of who had to come in, guess who's name wasn't on it?\nThey only have any power over you when they know you're afraid to lose your job.", "like_count": 6, "author_id": "UCpFNJgBUV5eraM-Lv5oCq0w", "author": "@szithaanu9934", "author_thumbnail": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqMqP5FG3NKFsmlAsSeP9BuhdYAHPTcA2QKe0pe-yw=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "parent": "root", "_time_text": "1 year ago", "timestamp": 1656892800, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpFNJgBUV5eraM-Lv5oCq0w", "author_is_uploader": false}, {"id": "UgxpViXRZTK0UYp0o_R4AaABAg", "text": "Especially in these times where the descriptor changes from \"unskilled labor\" to \"essential worker\" and back and forth.\n\n\"These are our heroes!\" goes to \"You're no longer necessary because you refuse to comply!

It was after a merger, they were eliminating redundancy, the over all business was contracting, so they needed to jettison bodies.  I say horrible because instead of doing it all at once and reassuring the remaining employees they will still have jobs... it was done quiet like, on the sly... so it was water cooler talk 'Yeah, did you hear about the Accounting department in Lubbock?  They let everyone go'... so that was how you'd hear.  Or you'd contact someone for something... and then find out they, and their entire department are gone.\n\nSo seeing the writing on the wall, I started looking for another job.  Got one, left before I got laid off.  But I said this was MORE stupid didn't I?  See, I went to work for a startup.  'We are like a family' and 'we work hard and play hard'.  I was concerned going to work for a start up, and I brought it up in the interview, to leave a job for a start up is risk.  At that point, I got a bald faced lie about their financials.  The business owner was lying to everyone about the funding he had.  Company goes tits up after about 4 months.  Severance?  I had to fight to get 75% of my last paycheck.  We are not talking unpaid vacation days, we are talking hours actually worked.  I could have sued for treble damages and won easily... but ever collect from a dead company?  So after losing that job, I got a good contract gig that lasted a year... when the year was up, another former employer talked me into coming back, not the company who's layoff I ducked, a different company.  I was hired for one job, then they threw me into another 'temporarily'... and a year later I still hadn't worked the job I was hired for... so I went BACK to the company that almost laid me off 2 years prior... they contacted me... they begged me to come back... \n\nSo I did.  And got laid off 14 months later.  So, I was so stupid that I successfully dodged a huge layoff, was even told by my old boss which layoff would have gotten me (I had about 4 more months, more than I thought, but not much)... only to come back two years later... and get laid off.\n\nSTUPID", "author_id": "UCbEIEFUCsZK0iqFcAzcVuQQ", "author": "@voodoochild1975az", "author_thumbnail": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqPrGc-R12Rzce6WCv9yVkI6pLjxpl9opkUOuA=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "parent": "root", "_time_text": "1 year ago", "timestamp": 1656892800, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbEIEFUCsZK0iqFcAzcVuQQ", "author_is_uploader": false}, {"id": "Ugxfl7mhtxyO5nqBudx4AaABAg", "text": "A previous employer told me that they’re letting me go due to the role being eliminated.

The company wrote the building manager over $90,000 worth of bad checks and I was shocked that criminal charges were not filed.  When the company had to lay off employees, the president told the employees that the last day was the coming Friday and that they did not have to come in on that Wednesday and Thursday.  Many employees did not show up on those days and when they applied for unemployment, the president told the unemployment office that the employees were a \"no call, no show.\"  Those employees were denied unemployment benefits.  I showed up until that Friday and the office manager was calling me into her office about 6 to 10 times berating me.  Her plan was to try to get me to quit, but I didn't.  I got my paycheck and you guessed it, it was written on a closed account.  I went out for unemployment and found out that the company never listed me as an employee, unemployment was denied.

They made you feel like you were worthless and they were doing you a favor by keeping you employed. They did it in an indirect way. They would also offer free snacks or drinks. Sounds like a great thing until you realize it was just to keep you working in the office longer. They could justify lower pay by saying hey you get free stuff. They would give swag away so you slowly begin to identify yourself with the brand. They would limit your time outside of work by doing happy hours after work and free meals so you didn't spend time with real friends or family. They would make it sound like they were going to be the next Google or apple. Irl they were just the next wework. There are other things but these are some things that looking back should have been obvious it's a bad company. I realized when my father died. I wanted to take time off. Officially we had unlimited vacation but when I tried they denied me because we needed to ship to our biggest customer. I never took vacation for 2 years but the exec and management took 3 weeks off every quarter. Than Covid hit and the entire executive team was wfh but the engineers were told to go in everyday because we are to critical to allow to wfh. Finally I had the courage to leave when I asked my non crucial coworkers how much they made. I found out they work 2 hours a day but made 3x my pay. In fact all the engineers left shortly after. They all woke up from the cult. Sadly they are still in business. They recruit only right out of college for engineers so you feel a blind loyalty to them from the start.

They are still going but it was off the wall. No one really knew what was going on, who was working etc. They dealt with customer complaints just by telling you what the customer said and that was it. Back you go to work. No blame. No reprecussions. No try not to do it that way again. On my days off they'd always ring to see if I would come in for a few hours so obviously no roster planning. Again, on days off they'd ring and say something like ''I know you were meant to be in at 9 but we'll forget about that if you can do an extra hour at the end of your shift''. I'd say ''I'm not rostered today''. They'd be silent and then say ''Oh yeah! I was looking at the wrong day. Sorry about that''. Finally, one night I was there working the nightshift and at 2am one employee went home sick.

I jumped ship only after I tried to hold it out to see just how it would go, even explaining it to my trainer before heading to HR. She helped and didn't help across 2 conversations across 2 consecutive days. In the first, she said she understood, didn't want either to commit to anything right then but wait until the next day, then said in the midst of telling something else that they have no control over what campaigns come their way (tempering the water only to turn the heat back up later on). The next day she was all understanding and what not. She pre-empted my speaking by saying she had something she wanted to tell me first; That all the project managers and at least one client did not want me to leave, that they liked my work on their respective campaigns. Even that my trainer had me labeled me as one of her \"superstars\". She was willing to take me off the insurance, but i remembered what she said the day before. I do not like insurance at all. Because I've known for at least a decade what's involved and want nothing to do with it. What she told me the day before set the stage for no choice later on. So I exercised my choice to not go back. Because I did such a good job with it, she said they would hold the door open for me if ever I wanted to return. What I gathered from it all was a recognition of my abilities that even I didn't understand. Until now. I got it quick, and they recognized that. Now I do too.

The hours sucked (usually 14 hours a day) and the pay was a complete joke (at the time in 1987 I was earning just $3.55 an hour)!! The overtime pay DID help afford my a new car....but I was living in a lousy single room apartment that had cockroaches thanks to my filthy neighbors!! It was the cheapest place I could find to live that was actually near my job, that I could actually afford on my income though!!! I had worked there nearly 5 years (I started in 1986) and it was a family run company, ran by a husband and wife team, who acted like they were \"everybody's friend\"!! But more than once I overheard them talking smack about some employee, and they'd randomly just fire people at times without any logic to why they would!!! In fact they had fired FOUR plant managers in the time I worked there! And they had changed everybody on the engineering staff at least twice as well!! And the owner of the company would constantly talk down to people even degrade them openly on the floor in full view of anybody in the shop often enough!! The day I had quit though, they had spent three months attempting to write me up for work I was basically FORCED TO DO by them!! And I was in a \"Damned if I do, Damned If I don't\" position because I feared for losing my income!! But for the last three months I was under orders from the company themselves as I said....so I just did what I was told when I was told to do it!! THEN the morning I quit I realized something!! I realized I had came to this job looking for work.....so I left this job looking for work!! I had just punched in at the time clock too......so I know it kind of shocked them when I punched back out, and headed to the door!! Oddly that same day I applied at the first temporary agency I passed by on my way home!! They offered me $5 an hour starting pay which was better than what I was earning anyhow!! So I accepted it....sadly nearly five years later I was still working for $5 an hour though, and still living in the crap hole apartment!!", "like_count": 1, "author_id": "UCiS_cOa_fsD-dTP6ClsLj6Q", "author": "@gregbenwell6173", "author_thumbnail": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqOGoqYZgPl89sK2yVjo0T8dthcU8nrPX4E1Vc8W=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "parent": "root", "_time_text": "1 year ago", "timestamp": 1656892800, "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiS_cOa_fsD-dTP6ClsLj6Q", "author_is_uploader": false}, {"id": "UgxX0OhD98ZjhHVhQcF4AaABAg", "text": "Fools Ball Table.

Unfortunately many companies use the word multitasking like it's a great thing, and like you said, unless you are a computer you cannot multitask. What many call multitasking is task switching, as you said. The best you can do as an individual is prioritize, get a certain task done until you can't go any further cause you have to wait on someone else, etc, and then move on to the next priority. Even so it always gets under my skin when you hear a manager get mad at an employee about why they didn't get 5 tasks that require an hour each done within an hour and then boast that they could get it done in less than that. It is amusing when an employee calls them on it by asking how or telling them to show them.

No amount of external factors is cause for allowing employees making near minimum wage to become less productive.
